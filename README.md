# Code Challenge: CRUD Operations System

This coding challenge was posted as a daily challenge in the [Code Connector](https://codeconnector.io/) Slack group. 

The goal of the challenge was to create a system that implements basic CRUD Operations, along with 'Undo' functionality, while preventing more than one operation to be done at once.

## Original Challenge:

```
Code Challenge:
Implement a function that supports basic CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete—while also allowing the user to undo the most recent action.
Requirements:
CRUD Operations:
Create: Adds a new item.
Read: Retrieves an item.
Update: Modifies an existing item.
Delete: Removes an item.
Undo: Implement a mechanism to undo the most recent action (Create, Update, or Delete).
You may use any programming language to implement this challenge
Bonus:
You can add additional error handling (e.g., trying to undo after no actions have been performed).
Concurrency Prevention: Ensure that the user cannot perform multiple actions simultaneously. The function should handle one request at a time.
Good luck!
```
